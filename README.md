# GROMACS_xyz_to_volume
Script was originally prepared 'ad hoc' for a friend. When I have a moment I'll improve it for general use. However it's so simpe that even if you don't know anything about programming you should be able to use it.
WARNING! your gromacs file with XYZ box sizes has to have all comments removed before using the script.
